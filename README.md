# An analysis on Raffles Medical Group
University Coursework on Tableau

// The overall aim of this project is to uncover the different types of trends that appear within Raffles Medical Group.
Dataset has been cleaned and extracted from previous annual reports and pulled into Tableau for data visualisation purposes.

Ultimately, from these insights obtained from the data extraction, I unveil some suggestions to prospective managers on what they can possibly do to address these issues.
